      <p>My dearest Shundruuu,</p>

      <p>
        I honestly have no idea why I decided to create this little quiz and put you through it… 
        but I really hope it made you smile, or maybe even made your fingers shake a little when you weren’t sure of the answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway… I like being mushy, so even if this cringes you out pro max, I don’t care. Here goes: 
        I love you, Shundruuu… I love you so much.
      </p>

      <p>
        Waking up to your “Moorningg sunshine” messages, texting you about every tiny, mundane thing in my day, 
        “controlling” you, getting on your nerves, not letting you hang up the call easily, and making sure you see me cry at least once a week… 
        all of it has become such a beautiful, irreplaceable part of my life. I wouldn’t trade a single moment of it for anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even when a hundred things could be going wrong around me, the one constant, the one safe place I always have is you. 
        You are my calm in the storm, my comfort, my safe space. 
        How do I even put into words something my heart and brain still can’t fully comprehend?
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite all the challenges and the chaos life throws at us, I am grateful for Darwinbox, because I found my future there, 
        and I guess some places do end up giving you the world. I love you, and I miss you more than words can say. 
        I can’t wait to see you, to run into your arms, and feel the entire world shrink until it’s just us. 
        It has always been you. It will always been you.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are my heart, my home, my forever. And no matter how many words I write, or how many little quizzes I make, 
        I will never be able to capture how much you mean to me.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 30px; text-align: center; font-size: 18px;">
        Forever and always,<br>
        Shuttu
