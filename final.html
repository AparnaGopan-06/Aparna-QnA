    <h1>💖 My Dearest Shundruuu 💖</h1>

    <p>I honestly don’t even know what came over me to make you sit through that little quiz… but I hope, somewhere in all of it, you felt even a fraction of how much you mean to me. I hope it made you smile, and maybe even made your heart skip a beat when you weren’t sure of an answer, just like mine does every time I think of you.</p>

    <p>I know I probably sound quite mushy here, and if this makes you cringe, I am apologetic about it. Because I need you to know this, with every bit of honesty in me: I love you, Shundruuu… I love you so, so much, more than my words, my thoughts, or even my heart can fully keep up with.</p>

    <p>Waking up to your “Moorningg sunshine” messages, telling you every tiny, mundane detail of my day, teasing you, annoying you, refusing to let you hang up the phone, and yes even making sure you witness my weekly emotional breakdown … all of it has become the most beautiful part of my life. I wouldn’t trade a single second of any of this for anything in this world.</p>

    <p>No matter how loud or chaotic life gets around me, you are my stillness. My anchor. My safe place. My home. You are the one thing that makes everything feel okay, even when nothing else is. I don’t know how to explain what you are to me, because what I feel for you is bigger than any language I know and words don't do justice to it.</p>

    <p>And as strange as it sounds, I will forever be grateful for Darwinbox, because it led me to you - to my person, my future, my forever. Some places really do give you everything you didn’t even know you were meant to find.</p>

    <p>I love you. I miss you in ways that feel almost impossible to describe. I can’t wait to see you, to run into your arms, and feel the whole world disappear until it’s just us again. It has always been you. It will always be you.</p>

    <p>You are my heart, my home, my forever. And no matter how many words I write, I know I will never fully capture how deeply, completely, and endlessly you mean to me.</p>

    <p class="signature">Forever and always,<br>Shuttu 🤍</p>
